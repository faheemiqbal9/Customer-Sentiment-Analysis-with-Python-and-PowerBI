12/22/2024,Nice variety of dishes - Cake slices too small - service attentive but not overbearing,4,4,4,4
12/22/2024,Sunday brunch. Great fun as usual. Thanks again,5,5,5,5
12/21/2024,"A few things to unpack here. The place itself is nice, but my wife , daughter and I had a very negative experience. We arrived at 520 pm , made resos and all. Got seated fast , place was maybe half full so great. We order , awesome! Fast forward to 630pm… “there was an issue with one of your orders … sorry!” Ok I get issues happen . We had 7pm tickets to the ballet at the Bluma Appel theatre up the street. So rushing a heavy meal was out only choice . The manager came over “ it will be 3 more mins” but it was 6 , I don’t want to sound like that guy, but if you can’t be accurate with your time and it’s already 1 hour we have been waiting , please just give a straight answer . He conmped a portion of the meal, ok that’s alright … But , the real kicker , my 11 year old ordered pasta with a protein . The meal was scorching hot , but she didn’t say anything at first, I looked over and asksed her what the issue was and she said it’s “kinda really hot “ so I dig in and holy heck man. Clearly this meal needed like 10-15 mins to cool , must have been under the heat lamp or something for a lengthy time. When we left she was in tears , I went back in to speak to the host and all she said “I’m sorry”. Ok thanks for the apology , but Im not ok with this . I’m not ok with this at all , I’m at a loss, our night was messed up , didn’t eat much at all since we had no time. Daughter in tears , it was irresponsible to serve a meal that hot to anyone let alone an 11 year old. I emailed the restaurant after. I’m not sure what to do I’m just very upset that my family’s night on the town was ruined , weather intentional , mistake or whatever , it happened. Management has my email , I hope they can correct this . I feel ripped off that I paid anything tbh and I’m not that guy I’m really not a complainer ever. This is my first review in fact , I hate that it’s just so bad. I don’t know if this is a bad place or a good place , I just know me and the wife and kid had a horrible time.",1,2,2,1
12/21/2024,"We eat often at Hot House and, as usual, we found the food to be very good, as well as the service. We have no complaints!",4,4,4,4
12/21/2024,We rarely go out to eat these days due to the cost. Unfortunately I was not thrilled with the food at Hothouse. We have been to this restaurant in the past prior to covid and the quality seemed much better. I guess this is the sign of the times,2,4,2,3
12/20/2024,The price to portion ratio was a little high. That said the food was nicely presented and delicious. The service was friendly and quick. When we're in the neighborhood again Hot House wiil be on our list to revisit. Especially if we're around for brunch. Thank you to all the staff for an enjoyable visit.,5,5,4,4
12/15/2024,"There is a great food variety that everyone with find something good to eat. They serve comfort food with a good variety of pastas, some curries, salads and other meat dishes. All the food that we ate that evening was great tasting and reasonably priced. They have a good drink menu with many beers on tap and bottled, ciders and a good selection of wine. The service was good and the food was delivered hot. It is a very large restaurant with ample seating and you do not feel like the tables are too close to each other. If you are in the area the Hothouse is worth visiting.",5,5,4,5
12/15/2024,Booked last minute this morning it was crazy busy but the food was great! It was a Sunday brunch buffet and there was so much food! Breakfast and lunch/dinner foods for all tastes. Our party included a 4 year old and even she enjoyed a lot of the food Will definitely go back!,5,5,5,5

12/13/2024,"Had a lovely dinner with friends. The soup - a curried chicken - was superb. The jambalaya remains the best I’ve tasted in Toronto. The tiramisu cake was tasty, as well. My dining partners seem to enjoy their meals. I would certainly bring others here!",4,4,4,4

11/30/2024,Very good food and the amount is appropriate. Also great service.,4,5,5,4
11/28/2024,"We enjoy coming here. However, it has become quite pricey. Hot House was always a bit lower than others, but not now.",5,5,5,4
11/21/2024,"Great dinner experience, great food. Service from the kitchen was a bit slow however. Id definitely go back again!",4,4,3,4

11/10/2024,We are regular clients because we enjoy the varieties and the great service,5,5,5,5
11/9/2024,"Great evening, restaurant was full. Our server, Sean gave great advice. Our reservation wa for 7:45pm, we were seated on arrival and service was prompt. Noise level was high at beginning but settled as the evening progressed.",4,5,3,4

11/2/2024,"Service and food was good. The booth we had was a little tight for the four of us. Overall, it was nice and we’ll go back again",4,5,4,4
11/2/2024,menu is fabulous - lots of interesting choices. prices are reasonable - very low. Service terrific. We had a reservation and were booked to a lovely booth (even though we were only 2 people),4,5,5,5
11/2/2024,We were a party of six and had a wonderful supper at the HotHouse. The food was delicious and the service provided by Aishwarya and the dining room staff was perfect!,5,5,5,5
11/1/2024,"Almost a perfect experience, marred by parents with noisy misbehaving children at the next table. The restaurant should not seat families with young children near guests that want to enjoy a nice evening. It’s insulting",5,5,4,4
10/30/2024,"Good food, something for everyone! Friendly service.",4,5,4,4
10/29/2024,Lovely waitress. Good food. Quiet. Very enjoyable. Can recommend!,4,5,5,4
10/27/2024,"I visited Hothouse for the Sunday buffet around 1 PM, and it was quite busy. The atmosphere was lively, but it did get a bit loud, and I noticed that the buffet table could have used more frequent cleaning due to the high volume of guests. If you're planning to visit, I would recommend arriving before noon or after 2 PM for a more relaxed experience",3,4,2,4
10/27/2024,Good service and kind staff. Good mediocre and overpriced brunch buffet.,2,3,3,3
10/27/2024,There's plenty of different breakfast and lunch food to choose from that will appeal to all palates and ages. A great live jazz band enhances the ambience.,5,5,5,5
10/27/2024,"Sunday Brunch is excellent as always, but at $45 it's quite pricey now",4,4,4,4
10/25/2024,Great food. Mezze platter and tutti mare risotto. Nice ambiance. Will return.,5,5,5,5
10/22/2024,Service was quite slow although staff were so personable. The meal was delicious though and portions are ample. Good value.,5,2,5,4
10/20/2024,"The Sunday brunch is great, and the staff are very friendly and attentive",4,5,5,4
10/14/2024,Thanksgiving dinner special: Turkey very dry but great vegetables and mashed potatoes; chocolate cake dessert very hard and stale,2,2,3,3
10/13/2024,Excellent food and atmosphere. Already planning our next visit.,5,4,5,5
10/13/2024,Another great Thanksgiving Dinner. The menu provided something for everyone.,5,5,5,5
10/13/2024,"We went for Thanksgiving dinner that was advertised as $30. Well, that's without appetizer or dessert. The whole meal is $48. It was hot and a huge portion, but not tasty! The turkey was some kind of processed turkey roll. The stuffing was soggy and tasteless. The cranberry sauce was Sour. The mashed potato was under a pile of all the other stuff and smeared on the plate but smeared differently on each person's plate - no consistency TD it was supposed to be decoration. We really felt like we were in a cheap dinner for Thanksgiving. Very disappointing.",1,5,2,2
10/13/2024,Breakfast buffet is always good just wish there were some more options,4,3,4,3
10/12/2024,"We were looking for a restaurant close to Mirvish Theater and found this place with a very good reviews. What a disappointment! The food is horrible. They advertise that their pasta is made fresh there but it tasted like very stored bought and lacking the flavors. Their Moroccan chicken with grilled vegetables was a joke! No flavor at all and 4 pieces of very thin slices of vegetables. The place is nice. Feels like a pub more, where you can get some food not to be hungry but don’t expect culinary experience. I don’t understand how it gets so high reviews. I spoke with our server about the food lacking the flavors and he actually agreed with me and said that lots of customers don’t like the flavors so they play safe. The point is he agreed. What a disappointment. I will never come back.",1,3,3,1
10/12/2024,"Had a very nice Sunday brunch on the patio of Hot House. May be one of the last days warm enough to do that. It was very nice. Food was good, waiter was attentive without being intrusive. Of course there is some street noise (the patio is right beside Front Street), but not bad",5,5,5,5
9/12/2024,Food was really good; had the chicken curry and it was great. Scotty was excellent.,5,5,5,5
10/6/2024,"great food, spacious, nice soft jazz music on sunday brunch",4,4,4,4
10/6/2024,"Food: To be honest, the food experience was a little disappointing… we understand the idea of shrinking the buffet menu is a method to improve its quality. Unfortunately I didn’t really see the improvement… the roast beef was on the dryer side and by the time I walked my dish back to my table, the meat was already cold. I wanted a small piece of salmon Wellington but the server was too busy making an omelet for someone else so I didn’t bother waiting. The salad bar was quite sad… they tried making a nice seafood salad but it was just a few pieces of shrimp and calamari over a large bed of mixed greens, which did not seem appealing to us. There were only a handful of cheese and cold cuts selection as well at the charcuterie section. Also, no muffins or danishes to choose from… very limited croissants and breakfast baked goods. The only thing that stood out to me was their delicious hot bread pudding. Otherwise, the mussels were alright and that was it. Service: We were greeted nicely once we arrived. The server kinda disappeared on us for a good chunk of time but, it didn’t bother us too much… our plates were still cleared in a timely manner but our coffees were running empty towards the end. She was quite friendly too. Atmosphere: The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere, still had their Sunday brunch live jazz which was great. Customers were all pretty chill, there was a pleasant large party that were seated close by to our table. Lovely environment. To add to it, the restaurant had a face lift and it’s slightly more modern than pre pandemic days, overall pretty clean. Overall, I’m not sure if we would be back anytime soon again. For the price tag, I expected a little more than what I experienced there on Sunday. I can see this being a great place to meet up and catch up with family and friends but don’t expect the food to be superb.",2,3,4,2
10/5/2024,"Service was very good. Food felt like a long wait but if it was, it was well worth it. Both my friend and I wanted to lick the plates clean it was so good. My friend had the chicken brocchette and I had the salmon. Both were fantastic. We each had peach cobbler for dessert which was very good. There were 3 or 4 other things on the menu we each wanted to try and we will definitely be coming back to try them.",5,4,4,5
9/28/2024,"Lovely relaxed and casual dinner on the patio on a warm early fall evening. Our food was excellent! A Cobb Salad, Steak Frites and Jambalaya was shared and enjoyed so much. Many thanks to the chefs! Our server was warm, friendly, professional and so organized . So appreciated and made the night a great time.",5,5,5,5
9/26/2024,"We had good expectations based on previous reviews. We arrived at the restaurant and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered drinks and our food and that's when we waited a long time. It was nearly an hour before our food arrived. We noticed another customer arrived, ordered, ate, and left before we even received our entrees (and we were a small party). Our server, Dana, didn't seem to care. She never once mentioned a delay, apologized, asked if we needed much. She just brought more water. The food itself was average. Not bad, not special. But the lack of service was really noticeable.",3,1,4,2
9/21/2024,"Good choices for a mixed group. We had curry, tuna poke, mac and cheese and the short rib. All excellent. Nice place",5,5,5,5
9/20/2024,Excellent service. Very nice innovative menu. Very pleasant view of Toronto.,5,5,5,5
9/20/2024,"Our server Sunil was very attentive and it was a pleasure to be served by him. The food was served quickly, and was delicious! Thank you.",5,5,5,5
9/19/2024,Great service. Nice table with view. Scrumptious food. What's not to love?,5,5,5,5
9/8/2024,Food is always amazing. The price has skyrocketed though making it not really worth the value. They already don't offer a big enough buffet. Now that it costs $45 pp its not worth it. The food was also running out and fresh items were not brought out quickly,4,5,5,4
9/1/2024,Great food and great service staff so friendly and welcoming 1000% will be back.,5,5,5,5
8/18/2024,The brunch buffet is so overrated. Not worth the price at all. None of the food had any seasoning. The food is made for old people… and it showed in the crowd. Save your money and go to a real brunch spot.,1,3,2,1
8/17/2024,"It's a nice go-to place for brunch and hanging out with friends. We enjoyed a lovely long lunch, and Scotty, our server was amazing -- prompt, attentive, and charming. Looking forward to my next visit in my favorite booth.",5,5,5,5
8/11/2024,Another wonderful dinner! Thanks again Hothouse!,5,5,5,5
8/5/2024,Food was okay but not great for the price. Waiter very good friendly and attentive.,3,4,3,3
8/1/2024,A very pleasant lunch - service matched our requirements as we were there for a relaxing chat with friends. Food and service was good - good bear are reasonable price,4,4,4,4
7/30/2024,My stir fry seemed bland last night and had to be sent back to be heated up as it was barely warm. The other two dinners of guests were good.,3,4,4,3
7/26/2024,"We went on a Friday for dinner and it was quite so great for having conversations. However the wine glasses were dirty as we saw stains on them under the lights. The complementary bread provided was cold and hard, contrary to what we were expecting. The main course was good. We ordered two different pasta dishes and were pleased to be able to remove wine from the dish. The service was good as well. Overall not a bad dinner restaurant near the St. Lawrence market.",5,4,4,4
7/21/2024,"As always with Sunday brunch, event food, great variety, from omelette, carved meat, lasagna and other favorites and fruit And sweets. Mimosa and coffee. Better of all the great service for our table of 7 with live music on top of it.",5,5,5,5
7/12/2024,I enjoy the Hot House restaurant. But was disappointed in Winterlicious menu. I should have opted for regular menu. More value for your money.,3,4,4,4
7/10/2024,"I tried the Summerlicious menu, excited about the Caribbean themed dinner. The fish croquettes were delicious, and the scotch bonnet sauce was a spicy firecracker that complimented the fish well. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the meal - the oxtail pappardelle was under seasoned and unnecessarily stodgy, lacking the flavour and depth one might expect from the dish. The rum cake was likewise heavy (though delicious), and lacked an element of brightness that it needs…citrus would have been appreciated, or a more concentrated and flavourful cherry compote than what was offered. Service was attentive and friendly, ambience was cozy and appropriate for a quiet meal. I enjoy eating at Hothouse most times, but did not find this particular meal satisfying.",2,4,4,3
7/8/2024,"The patio at Hot House is a shady, cool place to enjoy a drink or dinner on a hot summer evening in Toronto. The flowers are beautiful and minimize the noise from the street. Staff is prompt, helpful, food is delicious. Highly recommended, which is what I tell everyone when they ask about HotHouse!",5,5,5,5
7/7/2024,One of the best brunches in town and perfectly located for shopping the St Lawrence aferward.,5,5,4,5
7/3/2024,"It was a nice and welcoming restaurant, although I wasn’t the biggest fan of my meal. Other than that I enjoyed my time at Hothouse",2,3,3,3
7/3/2024,Food was outstanding. Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend the Hot House.,5,5,5,5
6/30/2024,"We are regulars at HOTHOUSE year round , especially before Leaf or Raptor games, average once a week when in town. Lately we have even the portion size shrink and items on the menu we love disappear too quickly ( East coast fish soup , Pisco Sour ) to name a few. Value is still good but less than before ( $30 for a small piece or salmon ) Many items haven’t changed ( Cobb salad , short rib ) and are great value. Still love the place but has slipped a bit.",3,5,4,3
6/30/2024,"Very nice spot, good food and servi6. Also value for money",5,5,5,5
6/28/2024,Excellent meal and service Quiet and nice ambience,5,4,4,5
6/28/2024,Enjoyed the patio service and food were great !!!!!,5,5,5,5
6/25/2024,An excellent friend might location with good food and wonderful service on the patio. Thank you!,4,5,4,4
6/23/2024,"Sunday brunch, best in the City, so much variety! Plus, and awesome Jazz Band in the centre of the restaurant. Value for the price, a+",5,5,5,5
6/23/2024,Super! I always like the place service is good. Staff are friendly. Food sand dessert very good to me . I always love cakes and waffles. Overall super even for the price per person on Sunday brunch.,4,4,5,5
6/19/2024,"Drinks, apps and dinner were all wonderful. Our waitress was excellent and friendly",5,5,5,5
6/16/2024,"It was just ok, we went for the brunch buffet and it was way too busy. We had a hard time moving around the buffet table because it was so busy. A lot of the food trays were empty. We had to cut it short because we were trying to get to a Blue Jay game and we couldn't wait for the food to come out",3,2,3,3
6/12/2024,"I booked for the patio, but it was too cold, so a very nice young man moved us inside. After the move, the table service was very slow, but the food was outstanding.",4,2,3,4
6/7/2024,"We've been coming to HotHouse for about 20 years. As always, the food and service did not disappoint! My friend and I shared two pasta dishes for lunch. The gnocchi with pancetta and a gorgonzola/mascarpone cheese cream sauce was delicious, with pillowy soft gnocchi and sauteed brown mushrooms nestled in the rich sauce. The penne Al olio had just the right balance of fresh vegetables (broccolini, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and sweet onions), pancetta and a lovely, light olive oil. We will be returning in July!",5,5,4,5
6/2/2024,Service was great! We arrived Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. The buffet offer many quality choices and good quantity based on how busy it was. The food was delicious and our party of five all had a wonder experience. Did I mention the live jazz band?! I'll be back for sure.,5,5,4,5
6/2/2024,The buffet is good with great ambiance/live jazz band. I don’t like that at payment the smallest automatic tip is 18% AND they calculate it based on the subtotal plus tax. I felt tricked after looking at my receipt when I got home.,4,3,5,2
5/27/2024,"Always a great meal when we’ve been to Hot House .. Mother’s Day brunch, lunch and dinner! Great food and prices are on point.",5,5,5,5
5/23/2024,Great service. Great food. Great ambience. International cuisine. Waiter tonight was awesome. My son is definitely a handful but the staff treated him awesomely! Will return.,5,5,5,5
5/19/2024,"Large patio, nice neighbourhood feel with friendly staff. Good value and something on the menu for everyone. Our small dog was welcome on the patio and they provided water for her. Will be back again soon.",5,5,5,5
5/19/2024,"This is my favourite place to celebrate my birthday. I love it here, and visit as often as time permits. The staff is great. The manager of the front of house staff is usually ok, few interactions. This year, he was chastising a buss boy near our table saying it’s not his job to do his buss job for him in different words. It was VERY rude and made my guests just as equally uncomfortable to hear that interaction. I hope that he can learn to coach and train his staff in a positive way instead of using threatening/intimidating methods *on the floor* to scare them into working better/faster.",5,4,5,4
5/18/2024,"This was a 1pm sitting on a Saturday. It was very quiet inside, so the ambiance did not have the usual vibes we get at the HotHouse. The food was good, but we would have liked to have the option of yoghurt instead of whipping cream on our French Toast and Pancakes.",4,4,3,3
5/18/2024,Always enjoy our visits to The Hothouse however our last one was particularly enjoyable and memorable (in a very good way) because of our server Hannah ..... excellence in every way.,4,5,5,5
5/17/2024,Great location. Great view of the street. Amazing patio. Also close to many theatres and attractions. Very good menu with many good options for diet restrictions. Super friendly staff. We had a great experience and plan on returning.,4,5,4,4
5/14/2024,"Excellent service and decent food, reasonably priced. Half price wine is fun, too.",4,4,4,4
5/12/2024,"My girlfriend receives emails from you on a regular basis so we booked a table for your Mother’s Day dinner buffet, expecting an oyster bar which was advertised with the buffet.. No oysters whatsoever at the buffet and other than the ‘made to order’ pastas, all the other dishes were cold, even though the serving pans were heated . Don’t think there’s anything you can do about that.. Also, your tip option on your debit machines shouldn’t start at 18% .. I know customers can custom their tips but so as to be easy & not have to calculate, perhaps you can start at 15%.? We were given $25 vouchers by the manager which compensated the experience last night so we will definitely go visit you again !:)",4,5,5,4
5/12/2024,Well we had a 6pm Dinner reservation and dinner I think started at 5. By the time we sat ordered our wine ALL the seafood was gone no oysters no shrimp. The tent cards advertising the Mothers Day dinner said Prime Rib and it wasn't. It said prime rib and lobster Mac and Cheese and they weren't even together. I didn't really know I was signing up for a buffet. Thought it was partial buffet and Prime Rib. I would not recommend this for a special night out. They had a pasta station right beside the Roast Beef BUT NO lobster MAC!,3,4,2,1
5/12/2024,"Wasn’t a typical great food experience that you would expect on Mother’s Day buffet. The family was expecting Oysters and Prime Rib since it was advertise for that and paid a bit extra for the special buffet menu, which is fine. First off the oyster bar had a huge line up since it was popular which is fine but they should’ve shucked the oysters ahead of time so it wouldn’t have to have such a long line up. Second by the time our group had a chance to go up to get oysters it was already done for the evening, the whole section was closed off at 615pm right in the peak of dinner rush, how’s does that happen wouldn’t you prepare to have enough oysters for all the reservations that you would have for the dinner rush? Third the Prime Rib wasn’t even Prime Rib it was like striploin roast or a sirloin roast so why would you advertise that it would be Prime Rib when it wasn’t, false advertisement to bring more guest in but should hold up to your standards. Totally not a good buffet considering the extra cost and I would stick to coming here on Brunch Buffet instead this was underwhelming and disappointed.",3,4,4,3
5/12/2024,The food and service was good. But the buffet tables setting was too close and people were bumping into each other. I would love to have more than 2 Oysters at a buffet dinner,3,3,3,3
5/12/2024,"Good service. Food was good, however they ran out of some stuff (shrimp/lobster) by 1.30pm",3,4,3,5
5/5/2024,"Went here on Sunday for the buffet, food was great, service was great, would definitely come back again",5,5,5,5
5/4/2024,"Food was delicious, service was excellent, and staff were friendly and helpful. Servings are very large.",5,5,5,5
5/2/2024,"Came for weekday lunch Great location Very spacious with outdoor dining Our server was very professional, attentive when required Food was good mussel dish was small & missing crusty bread on side",4,5,4,4
5/1/2024,The Aperol Spritz seemed to be missing the Aperol….complaining to the waitress had no effect!,4,4,4,4
4/28/2024,Very nice selection of food items. Hot and fresh! Desserts were delicious with good variety. Breakfast items were good and good variety. Live band was nice touch-good ambience. Cheeses and chacouterie items delicious,4,4,4,5
4/21/2024,The place is always amazing and we are there at least once week,5,5,5,5
4/20/2024,Service a little spotty (meals delivered at different times) but otherwise okay.,4,4,4,4
4/20/2024,We were here with my Brother and His wife. They live next door and eat here frequently and as always it was great. We have eaten here multiple times over the years and it is consistently good.,5,5,5,5
4/19/2024,Our server was very attentive without being intrusive The food was great,5,5,5,5
4/19/2024,Salmon delicious. Southern BBQ chicken excellent. Key lime pie out of this world. All staff very friendly. Blue grass band outstanding.,5,5,5,5

4/18/2024,"Greta location, not too busy for an after work dinner with my team. Varied and robust menu. Great cocktails. Food was fast and tasty!",4,4,4,5
4/18/2024,"Hothouse was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm glad we tried it. The food was magnificent, the wine was divine, and our server was very friendly with the biggest smile. We arrived a little late for our reservation after letting them know we'd be late (because Toronto traffic), and there was no issue. The table they'd set aside for us was next to a window table, which was offered since it was available, so we gladly accepted. The wait staff were attentive in clearing away dishes when we were finished with them. Everything about dining here was great! Noise level was ok, but I imagine when it's packed it would be a little noisier since the tables are quite close together. Still, this is a great dining location!",5,5,5,5
4/14/2024,"Needed somewhere to eat with my wife, daughter & wife's cousin on a Sunday evening. This spot worked out really well. Service was good. Food very tasty. A nice evening was had",4,4,4,4
4/14/2024,"Great experience. Would definitely go back. Choices of food wasn’t as varied as it used to be, however, still very good",4,5,5,4
4/14/2024,We always love Hot House but this time 3 out of 4 of our guests got sick afterwards. One of which is still sick today. Maybe something went bad in the buffet.,3,4,4,3
4/14/2024,"Good and service were great! Great variety for a brunch. Everything was fresh & very tasty! The jazz type band was lovely, though a hint loud at times as we were sitting in same section. Lovey was to spend a couple hours on a Sunday morning. Thank you!",4,5,4,4
4/13/2024,"This is a GREAT place for good food and great service before theatre. Attentive, friendly service, and a great location and backed up with a great menu and tasty food.",4,5,5,5

4/11/2024,"The vegan burger was very greasy. The salad was over dressed and soggy. Not good at all. The waiter was good and the restaurant was empty. I wonder why? Maybe a rainy day? I haven’t eaten at the Hot House for a long time, but I will not be back any time soon.",1,5,4,2
4/7/2024,We went for the Sunday brunch. The food was amazing. The only negative was that it was so noisy that we could not hear the live jazz music... I would ask to sit closer to the performers next time.,5,4,4,5
4/7/2024,"Sunday brunch was the best! Loved everything from the live jazz band playing, the upbeat servers and SO MUCH FOOD to choose from! Amazing experience and looking forward to next time very soon.",5,5,5,5
4/6/2024,"Unfortunately did not enjoy our time here, sat down at 5:30 (we had a reservation at 5:45 but they were able to seat us early which was good) and then proceeded to sit there for an hour with no food, one jug of water for the table only and no starters were brought out once we ordered. When we brought this to their attention they checked on our food and brought it immediately 2/3 dishes were warm but unfortunately one was cold. We were now late for our plans so we had to eat very quickly. Food that was hot was delicious but couldn’t really be enjoyed due to how long we had to wait. Not sure what had happened and we understand that it was a busy Saturday, however we watched lots of tables recieve service and food far quicker. We have been here before and loved it hence our return. Unfortunately we don’t think we will come back again, the taste of the food is not worth the cost and wait.",4,2,2,1
4/6/2024,"Despite being very busy, The Hothouse was good as usual",4,4,4,3
4/2/2024,Dinner with my aunt & cousin. It was during the week and wasn’t very busy. Food was delicious and service was great. Love the decor and location. Will be back.,5,5,5,5
3/31/2024,Great food and location to our hotel. Lots of staff clearung your dishes. Great atmosphere.,4,4,5,5
3/31/2024,"Although this restaurant is easy to access using transit or other means, the menu is pedestrian at best. The set up is abstract. The carving station and omelet site are at the bar, while the remainder of the food that would go with these options is located in the back. I am not sure why the dessert and salads could not be at the bar, so that the mains were all located in one location. The food while good, is not special at all. There are limited salads, none with lettuce. The pasta is the salad was dry, not undercooked, just dry(left out too long). The cheese selection consited of 2 cheeses, both cheddar. Having cold salmon on a buffet is not special any more. The mains were ok, but again nothing fancy. At the carving station they offered leg of lamb, ham, roast beef(not prime rib) and salmon wellington. The beef was a bit tough and unfortunately the salmon wellington although looking good, was flaky on the ouside and wet and mushy on the inside. Not a great dish. The location is nice and the service was very good for a holiday buffet. My only comment is that although I do enjoy some jazz, it would be nice if the small band could mix it up a bit and play something besides jazz. or perhaps a bit upbeat. The price was extravagant for the meal that was provided. This no longer a place I would recommend to friends or relatives. The quality of food has gone down from what it used to be.",2,4,3,3
3/31/2024,"Amazing experience, would definitely go again!!!!!",5,5,5,5
3/30/2024,As always… great food and service. I’m glad we made a reservation. I have been coming here for years and it’s usually pretty busy especially when events are going on.,5,5,5,5
3/30/2024,We had such a sweet server on Saturday - great service and one of my family’s favourites,4,5,4,5
3/29/2024,"The Maritime Fish Cakes from the Easter menu were delicious. But both my friend and I thought the Banana Leaf Cod was really bland. I usually eat very bland too and thought the fish had no taste. But the atmosphere was nice and and it was quiet. Our server was friendly and when we told her we needed to leave by 7pm to catch a show, she was on top of things. Our food came quickly shortly after and we were out by 6:58pm!",3,5,4,3
3/24/2024,"The Sunday brunch is awesome. The food is very tasty and there is lots of variety. It was as good as I had remembered, as this was the 1st time since COVID that I have been back. I do think it's a bit pricey...while it is all you can eat, don't believe it should be as expensive as it is - but it was enjoyed.",5,5,4,4
3/23/2024,"Great food, easy vibes, happy customers! Would absolutely go again and again!",5,5,5,5
3/21/2024,I love the location and the atmosphere. The quality of the food was not as good as it had been over the past 10 years that we have been dining here. We’ll try again - hopefully it was just an off day.,3,5,5,3
3/18/2024,"Requested a booth, identified it was a special occasion - we were directed to a table seat overlooking construction. Had to request a move.",5,4,2,4
3/14/2024,"Me and my family went there last sunday for their Sunday brunch buffet and I just want to say is a delightful culinary journey, offering an exceptional dishes like, Oven salmon, roasted beef, lasagna, brunch, omelette station. Priced at $45, the value is outstanding, especially considering that it includes unlimited tea and coffee, making it a perfect complement to the meal. The array of options, from freshly baked pastries to gourmet hot entrees, is impressive, ensuring that there's something for everyone. The atmosphere is inviting, with attentive service that enhances the overall dining experience. This brunch is not just a meal; it's a feast that turns a regular Sunday into a special occasion worth savoring.",5,5,5,5

3/3/2024,Food was enjoyable. Perhaps not to everyone’s specifics. I found the apple crisp to be very heavy on the cinnamon side. Enough so that I couldn’t finish my small portion. The lobster Mac and cheese was really good ! And mimosas were very fun and reasonably priced. I would like a toaster with a broader selection of breads,4,5,5,4
3/3/2024,Delicious variety of food. Best brunch buffet in the city!,5,5,5,5
3/2/2024,Good food and good service . Have been before and will come back,5,5,4,4
3/2/2024,"I ordered Gnocchi Pommodoro (pommodoro is tomato sauce). The details indicated that it had 'basil puree"". I don't like basil, I find it too overwhelming, but since these were gnocchi in pommodoro sauce I thought I could just put the basil puree to the side. But it was not just the little basil puree.. the ""pommodoro"" was a tomato sauce full of chopped basil leaves. It was maybe ok for someone who likes basil, but I really didn't like it. I mentioned it to the manager, and he offered to change it to me, which I thought was a nice way to resolve the issue, but I didn't accept because I had eaten half of my plate. The dish was ok (though I am very picky with gnocchi and didn't like the consistency too much though) but I suggest they change the name of the dish to ""Gnocchi Pommodoro and Basil"" because I mostly tasted the basil which for me it was overwhelming.",1,3,4,3
2/27/2024,Have been going there ONCE a week for several months,5,5,5,5
2/25/2024,"Hothouse was a nice place to celebrate our birthday. The place was beautiful and the quality of food was good in general. The ambiance was a 10/10 thanks to the relaxing live music, the wide windows, and the staff's attention. Maybe charging $45 for brunch seems a bit excessive though, especially when other places have tons of options for $10 less.",3,4,5,4

2/22/2024,"It's a good location but the quality of the food was not up to the task The restaurant was quite empty, and a lot of seniors. I was in this restaurant many years ago and the quality was above average it was sad to see the quality went down.",3,4,3,3

2/21/2024,"The service was excellent but the Jumbalaya thought very tasty, skimped on the shrimp.",4,5,4,4
2/19/2024,Muscles in white wine sauce were amazing. Service was good. Lasagna was a nice change up from the norm. Burger was pretty good but nothing to write home about. Would go again.,4,4,4,4

2/14/2024,"We come to the HotHouse very often but this was our first time at valentines’ day. It was not a good experience: the dishes we ordered were sold out (even though we were there at 630pm) and our server was clearly overwhelmed. We felt we were always waiting to get our drinks, or trying to get her attention, we spent a ton of time there just drinking water… my partner ordered the ribeye steak and it was very fatty, mostly inedible. We ended up cutting the night short and going elsewhere to get a drink a burger.",3,1,3,4
2/14/2024,We both loved our mains. Lovely service. but.........BEST FRENCH FRIES IN THE COUNTRY. LOL WE raved about them all night. Been to this restaurant many times and have never once been disappointed.,5,5,4,5
2/14/2024,"Upon the auspicious occasion of Valentine's Day, my esteemed wife and I had the pleasure of dining at the distinguished establishment known as the Hot House Restaurant for luncheon. From the moment we crossed the threshold, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of impeccable civility, with the staff exuding a warmth and politeness that bespoke their earnest endeavors to ensure that each patron's experience was of the highest order. Our repast commenced with a selection of mezzes, a testament to the culinary arts' ability to transform simple ingredients into a symphony of flavors. This was followed by an exquisitely prepared Jambalaya, a dish that sang with the spices of the South, and a Half rack of BBQ ribs, its succulence enhanced by the perfect complement of French fries. The Atlantic Salmon, a marvel of the chef's skill, was cooked to perfection, its flavors harmonizing beautifully on the palate. The denouement of our gastronomic journey was the Hot House Signature Tiramisu, accompanied by a cup of tea and a double espresso - each a delightful epilogue to the meal. The confluence of these culinary delights culminated in a bill of $141, a trifling sum for the quality and service rendered. In sum, our experience at the Hot House Restaurant was nothing short of sublime, a testament to the establishment's commitment to culinary excellence and unparalleled service. It stands as a beacon of fine dining, and I am compelled to commend it to the discerning gourmand as a destination of choice.",5,5,5,5
2/7/2024,"We have been to this location many times and it is always a pleasure! The staff is friendly, the speed at which the food arrived was perfectly timed and the food itself never disappoints. We will of course, be back. Thank you for the fantastic food!",5,4,5,5
2/4/2024,"The selection range of the course is limited. We are there around noon, some of popular dishes, such as salmon has not much left and no refill from the restaurant. The 65$ including tax and tips I would more prefer to go a la carte",3,3,3,3
2/4/2024,"If you feel like having the best brunch ever in Toronto, this is the place you have to go to. Looking forward to returning for the experience soon! Loved the jazz ambience! And the food!!!",5,5,5,5
2/4/2024,"Great Place to eat, the wife loved it. The jerk chicken was amazing.",5,5,5,5
2/4/2024,Brunch was great. Wonderful selection for sure. But the price of $45.00 per person is steep even for Toronto. Beverages are plus that.,5,3,4,4
2/3/2024,"This is not a remark against the restaurant; it's an observation and comment on people's etiquette. Noise level...was not ""energetic"". It was too loud. As in, people's conversations. In proper etiquette form, we were raised to speak in a quiet voice...not so the three tables around you can hear everything you say. But, I know this is a useless point to make, because it seems manners, politeness and grace left town years ago. This made our dinner date less enjoyable, having to converse over everyone else's conversations. I will try a different restaurant for our next dinner date.",4,5,2,4
2/3/2024,Great food and service. Would defintely recommemd. The only thing I would suggest is that they should inform customers who book online that there is a window from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm on Saturdays where you cannot order entrees as the kitchen changes from brunch to dinner menu. It would have been helpful for us to be aware since we had a reservation for just before the switch.,5,5,5,4
1/28/2024,"The server was welcoming, smiling all the time, and gave us a positive energy.",5,5,5,5
1/28/2024,I took my friend for a Hot House experience. We will rate it 5 stars but a bit disappointed that they stopped making the waffles and the dessert table was completely done. $45 is not.a bad price for a buffet but you cannot just stop serving desserts just because you there's less customers around.,4,4,4,4
1/28/2024,Sunday is chaos. Try another day. As a senior with walker it was hard to do a buffet. Prefer to be served.,3,4,4,3
1/27/2024,"Many people working there but no one seems to know their job. Six people at our table, meals came for five , sixth person waited an extra 10 minutes for their food to arrive, after WE mentioned it to our server. (Not even an apology) Place is outdated! Visiting the Hothouse for Sunday Brunch years ago was great, but this place is definitely on the decline.",2,1,1,2
1/24/2024,This is a terrific find. Everything you could want in a modern downtown eatery. Last night was my third visit and I plan many more.,5,5,5,5
1/22/2024,"Unpressured, enabling our group to visit with each other, with service when we signaled and occasional checks to see how we were doing - and excellent server. Everyone was very happy with their choices; the food was delicious.",4,4,4,4
1/21/2024,"Went for Sunday brunch. It is busy, but the food is pretty great. Definitely worth checking it out! Service was perfect and they kept the buffet filled.",5,5,4,5
1/21/2024,Everything great coffee and tea could be included with the 45 dollar price,5,5,5,5
1/21/2024,"The food options are not as good as they used to be. Poor bread options, no good meats and desserts were too dry.",3,4,4,3

1/20/2024,"Dined at a gem! Ambiance was captivating, food exquisite, and service impeccable. From the cozy decor to the delightful menu, every detail radiated excellence.

1/19/2024,It was an amazing experience the food was amazing,5,5,5,5
1/19/2024,"I have been to the Hothouse Cafe before and it's always been great. However, this last visit was chaotic. There seemed to be something amiss with the orders and there were several diners including us who were waiting quite a while to be served drinks, and then the food took the better part of an hour. Not our server's fault - he knew we were going to the theatre for an 8 pm curtain, so our 6 pm reservation should have been sufficient time.",3,2,2,3
1/19/2024,"I always enjoy eating here before seeing a show at Canadian Stage or Meridian Hall. On this particularly cold night, the Baked Quatro Mac and Cheese was delicious comfort food. And, they have one of the best Sticky Toffee Puddings I've ever eaten",5,5,4,5
1/19/2024,Excellent meal. Alex our server was very professional and friendly. Enjoyed our meal very much and will be back!,5,5,4,5
1/19/2024,"We had been repeat customers, but... We made a reservation with Hot House through Open Table for 6:30pm, and explicitly noted in the reservation that ""we need to finished in time to make it to an 8pm show at Meridian Hall"". We ordered our food around 6:35pm; at that time, we told our server that we needed to get out the door by roughly 7:30-7:40 so we would not be rushing down the street to get to our show. She served our starter salads within about 15 minutes or so, but then when we had not seen anything in terms of our entrées (time now around 7:10pm or so), we got nervous and began asking her to please prompt the kitchen since we didn't want to have to ""wolf down"" our main dishes and then rush out. (Subsequently and on three separate occasions/concerns being raised, she promised she was prompting the kitchen.) Well, the main courses finally showed up at 7:30pm. This was roughly 55 minutes after ordering them. The food was great, but it was an unpleasant experience to have to ""wolf them down"" after all - when we had provided multiple prompts/requests to try to avoid that very fate. While the restaurant was busy, it was by no means packed, nor did it appear that all the patrons had time constraints like ours. So in sum, we don't understand why it took the kitchen so long to put together basic pasta dishes, when some simple prioritization of their cooking would have avoided all of that. Pay attention to your customers' requests, please!",4,2,3,3
1/18/2024,Had a great dining experience. Service was on point. Food was tasty. Good sized portions. Great drink list. Will be returning for another meal.,5,5,5,5
1/15/2024,Good value yet again. A neighbourhood gem. Thank you.,5,5,5,5
1/15/2024,"The steak frites was cooked exactly as requested. The beef short rib was fall-off-the bone tender and flavour packed with creamy, tasty mashed sweet potato. The Tiramisu is mandatory for dessert. Our server, Antonia, was attentive and engaging without being overbearing. She made our birthday evening extra special. Thank you.",5,5,5,5

1/14/2024,"Location was great for meeting our friend. The cost of the buffet was much more than I expected. Pretty sure I didn't eat enough to cover the $45. The food was good but not outstanding. There was reasonable choices but again, nothing was outstanding. I wouldn't recommend the buffet to people due to the cost and I haven't had anything from the a la carte menu",3,4,4,3
1/13/2024,Found a quiet place for dinner before the Leaf game. Found it relaxing and gave us plenty of time to get to the game.,5,5,5,5

1/13/2024,Took my son there for lunch before a show. I had fond memories of going there with my mom when I was young. The food was just okay. The location is very convenient for the local theatre.,3,4,4,4
1/12/2024,"Nice atmosphere but the food was only average.  I had the Thai noodles; I asked for no chicken and extra tofu.  They forgot the tofu.  When I mentioned it, they brought me a tiny saucer of microwaved tofu. It looked a little unsightly and was completely unseasoned.  My wife had the veggie stir-fry and it was a little plain.",3,4,4,4
1/12/2024,"The food is incredible and will always keep us coming back but last night, Saturday night, was very busy. The service was poor, our appetizers arrived cold and it was clear my partner's main dish had been sitting, not due to temperature, but because the linguine noodles were mush by the time they arrived to the table. It took an hour to receive our food and were rushing out the door for a performance even though we left ourselves 1½ hours to eat. My dish, the Sicilian Gnocchi, was spectacular, as always.",4,2,4,4

1/7/2024,"GOOD: 1. FOOD : Although the food has somewhat lessened in quality from last year's and previous years, it is still a decent brunch. 2. JAZZ BAND & AMBIENCE : The jazz trio has improved. They provide a great vibe to the place with their smooth jazz. COULD IMPROVE: 1. WAITING STAFF: a) Red-haired, long-haired greeter/hostess: I reserved for a party of 9 (turned to 6 on the day of). They wanted us to sit at the back of the restaurant, far from any other people. I thought it was strange and requested a table closest to the jazz band. I saw her argue rudely with one of the servers who asked for me. When I approached her, she gave me attitude and said "" Well, there was no notification of your wish to sit next to the band on your reservation"". I told her, "" Ok, I made this reservation from months ago and I am giving you the notification now"". She proceeded to tell me that the reason why they cannot sit us next to the band is that there is only one server in that location to which I replied, "" Well, that's not our fault as patrons "". She then proceeded to complain about the 30-member guests who DID NOT HAVE RESERVATIONS and said, "" It's been a disastrous morning ""...to which I then replied, "" So you accommodate 30 people who didn't make reservations in front of the jazz band and you don't accommodate us who made reservations from months ago bc we simply failed to note it on our reservation note online?!"". She eventually gave us the table. When we left, I said "" Thank you "" and was ignored. b) Short, glass-wearing, mustached, dark-haired Italian looking waiter: When I asked him what drinks he was piling on to the tray, he gave me a somewhat grumpy look as if I was interrupting him. When I smiled and said thank you to his response, he just didn't say anything. I understand that people are busy but have courtesy to patrons.",4,3,4,4

My son had the salmon and “ Montreal “ bagel. We are from Montreal , so he was excited to get a “ Montreal “ bagel. It was NOT a Montreal style bagel. But two later plain bagels that almost felt were bought from Walmart. Food was cold for all 3 of our meals. Not worth the $$$. Food was average. The only thing great about that restaurant was our lovely waitress from Ireland. She was very sweet. We will not be going back for another meal.",2,3,3,3

1/1/2024,"Good, dependable and tasty food. Great service from individual staff members. Perfect noise level from the live jazz ensemble to allow for talking without yelling, but still enjoyable and audible. The kitchen had a difficult time keeping up with demand for the brunch options. There were usually 3-4 empty trays at any given time. I went back 3 times for the lobster mac and cheese and it was always empty when I went. Maybe it was busier than expected (we were there for NY day brunch) but that was frustrating, not to be able to access the preferred brunch options. Good value on mimosas (2 for $10) and lovely service from the host and our server. I did see a stack of clean dish racks partially blocking the hall to the bathroom which was impeding a man in a wheelchair from getting there. He was understandably frustrated.",4,5,4,4
